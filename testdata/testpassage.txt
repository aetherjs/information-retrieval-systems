The primary monoamine neurotransmitters are dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin. Dopamine and norepinephrine are catecholeamines, whereas serotonin is an indolamine. The amino acid tyrosine is not an essential amino acid because it can be synthesized in the liver from phenylalanine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase.
Norepinephrine is synthesized from dopamine by means of the enzyme Dopamine Beta-Hydroxylase (DBH), with oxygen, copper and Vitamin C as co-factors. Dopamine is synthesized in the cytoplasm, but norepinephrine is synthesized in the neurotransmitter storage vesicles. Cells that use norepinephrine for formation of epinephrine use SAMe (S-AdenylMethionine) as a methyl group donor. Levels of epinephrine in the CNS are only about 10% of the levels of norepinephrine.

A force always causes the centripetal acceleration. For a swingball (or tetherball) game, it is the tension in the string. For a satellite, it is the force of gravity. For a car moving around a corner, it is the frictional force between the car and the road. If you remove that force, you remove the centripetal acceleration, and if you remove the centripetal acceleration, the object will continue in a straight line tangent to the circle. Equation

What are lipids? Lipids are one of the four major groups of organic molecules; the other three being proteins, nucleic acids (DNA), and carbohydrates (sugars). Lipids are made up of the same elements as carbohydrates: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. However, lipids tend to contain many more hydrogen atoms than oxygen atoms. Lipids include fats, steroids, phospholipids, and waxes. One main characteristic of lipids is that they do not dissolve in water. What do they do? Lipids play an important role in living organisms. Some of their main functions include energy storage, hormones, and cell membranes. Types of Lipids Fats. What are fats? Fats are composed of a glycerol molecule and three fatty acid molecules.

Lipid Definition Lipids are class of naturally-occurring organic compounds that you may know by their common names: fats and oils. A key characteristic of this group of compounds is that they are not soluble in water.
Molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates have an affinity for water and are called hydrophilic (“water-loving”). Lipids, however, are hydrophobic (“water-fearing”). Some lipids are amphipathic—part of their structure is hydrophilic and another part, usually a larger section, is hydrophobic.

Although time subscripts are sometimes omitted, the intuition behind the Fisher equation is the relationship between nominal and real interest rates, through inflation, and the percentage change in the price level between two time periods. So assume someone buys a $1 bond in period t while the interest rate is it. If redeemed in period, t + 1, the buyer will receive (1 + it) dollars. But if the price level has changed between period t and t + 1, then the real value of the proceeds from the bond is therefore.

The Color Gray The color of detachment, indecision and compromise. The color gray is an unemotional color. It is detached, neutral, impartial and indecisive - the fence-sitter. From a color psychology perspective, gray is the color of compromise - being neither black nor white, it is the transition between two non-colors. The closer gray gets to black, the more dramatic and mysterious it becomes. The closer it gets to silver or white, the more illuminating and lively it becomes. Being both motionless and emotionless, gray is solid and stable, creating a sense of calm and composure, relief from a chaotic world. The color gray is subdued, quiet and reserved. It does not stimulate, energize, rejuvenate or excite. In the meaning of colors, gray is conservative, boring, drab and depressing on the one hand and elegant and formal on the other, yet never glamorous. Gray conforms - it is conventional, dependable and practical. It is a color of maturity and responsibility, associated with the gray hair of old age.

This article is about the ornamental fish. For other uses, see Goldfish (disambiguation). The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes. It was one of the earliest fish to be domesticated, and is one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the koi carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is a domesticated version of a less-colourful carp (Carassius auratus) native to east Asia.
A goldfish can survive for a short time in an unfiltered small bowl or in a tank with poor water quality, but if he lives in unfit water for very long, his life will be shortened considerably. Healthy goldfish live on average 15 to 20 years, while those kept in unhealthy conditions, even well-cared-for otherwise, live an average two to three years. A filter is necessary to maintain the type of water quality a goldfish needs to live a long and healthy life.
